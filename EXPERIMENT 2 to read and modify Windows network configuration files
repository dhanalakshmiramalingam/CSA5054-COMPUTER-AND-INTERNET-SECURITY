1. Update /etc/hosts by adding a new hostname mapping: 
 
 
def modify_hosts(): 
"""Adds a custom hostname mapping to the Windows hosts file.""" 
if not os.path.exists(HOSTS_FILE): 
print("[ERROR] Hosts file not found!") 
return 
try: 
# Backup the hosts file before modifying 
shutil.copy(HOSTS_FILE, HOSTS_FILE + ".bak") 
with open(HOSTS_FILE, "a") as file: 
file.write("\n192.168.1.100 mycustomhost\n") 
print("[SUCCESS] Hosts file updated.") 
except Exception as e: 
print(f"[ERROR] Failed to update hosts file: {e}") 
 
 
2. Restart networking services after modification using: 
 
def restart_network(): 
"""Flushes the DNS cache to apply changes.""" 
try: 
os.system("ipconfig /flushdns") 
print("[SUCCESS] DNS cache flushed. Changes applied.") 
except Exception as e: 
print(f"[ERROR] Failed to flush DNS cache: {e}") 
 
if _name_ == "_main_": 
# Step 1: Read and display the hosts file 
read_hosts() 
 
# Step 2: Modify the hosts file 
modify_hosts() 
# Step 3: Flush DNS cache to apply changes 
restart_network()
